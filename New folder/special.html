        <h3 class="head">HALASANA</h3>
        <p class="para">Lie down flat on your back. Keep your legs close together and your chin tucked in.
          Breathe deeply. Inhale. Lift your legs upwards till your feet point directly up - that is, till your legs are perpendicular to your torso.
          Tuck your hands underneath yourself with your palms facing up. With your hands under your buttocks, prepare to raise your torso.
          Lift your torso gradually till you are resting on your shoulders.
          Your arms must now be bent at the elbow. Bring your hands to your back to support yourself. Your legs should be over your head.
          Slowly straighten your back.
          Keep your knees firm but relax your calf muscles now. Maintain the posture. You are now in the Sarvangasana posture.
          From here, lower your legs forward so that your feet touch the floor over your head. 
          Now, bring your arms down flat on the floor. Breathe evenly and maintain this posture for about 30 seconds.</p>

        <h3>VASHISHTASANA</h3>
        <p class="para">straight in tadasana, place your palms on the mat, and keep your legs back. 
          Now assume the plank pose, lift your left hand, and place it a little ahead of the left shoulder. 
          Now press your left palm on the ground and turn your body to your left. 
          While making this move, the outer edge of your left foot should be touching the mat while your right foot should be stacked over the left one. 
          Keep your right hand in the air and rest your body on the right hip. 
          At this point, you have to balance your body using your left foot and left hand. 
          Breathe out, stretch your right leg, bend your upper body so that you can reach your right big toe. 
          Grab the right big toe using your right hands thumb, index finger, and middle finger. 
          Now, lift your right leg up, straighten your right arm, rotate your head to the left and gaze at the ceiling. 
          This is the Vasisthasana yoga pose, you have to pause here for about 20 to 30 seconds taking deep breaths. 
          While exiting the Vasisthasana pose, you have to first release your big toe, bring your right foot on the left one, and your right hand on your hips. 
          Breathe out and turn your whole body to the center. 
          You can repeat the Vasisthasana sequence pose to the other side just by changing your legs and hands. </p>

         <h3>SIRSASANA</h3>
         <p class="para">After taking a few breaths, exhale, take a gentle swing from the floor and lift the legs off the ground with bent knees. 
          take the swing in such a way that both feet leave the floor simultaneously.
          Stretch the legAs and stand on the head, keeping the whole body perpendicular to the floor.
          Take care to maintain equilibrium making sure the spine, hips and thighs are in line.
          Relax the whole body as much as possible by breathing slowly and deeply and if comfortable close the eyes and stay focused.
          At the beginning, the entire weight would be felt at the neck and shoulders including the elbows too, but with practice the most of the body weight will move towards the head and you will find less tension at the neck and shoulders.
          In this final pose of Salamba Sirsasana, bring the focus to balancing the body with breathing and pull in the tummy making the abdominal muscles tight thus giving strength to the spine making sure the imbalance is reduced.
          After taking a few breaths in the final pose for a comfortable time, come back by flexing the knees and sliding them down to the floor in exhalation in reverse order and then release the neck and shoulders and finally the head off the floor.
          Go back on your back in supine and prepare the body for Savasana taking a few breaths and then go into Sarvangasana
          for a few breaths in order to release any stress at the neck and shoulders while at the practice of Sirsasana.</p>

        <img src="./images/Handstand-Scorpion-Taraksvasana.jpg"alt="VASHISHTASANA" class="d-block" style="width:100%"> 
        <h3>TARAKSVASANA</h3>
        <p class="para" id="intro">
          Start to draw your spine into a large curve as you bend your knees and look forward slightly to lift your head without compressing the back of your neck (cervical spine). 
          In forearm stand, your hips are pretty much over your shoulders. 
          For your body to move into the classic C-shape of Scorpion, your hips and pelvis will begin to drop forward to hover over the top of your head. This is facilitated as you begin to curve your spine into extension.
          Draw your two big toes toward each other to touch as your knees remain separate and wide. 
          Be mindful of collapsing into a backbend and compressing your lumbar, ensuring you are emphasizing strength and stability over flexibility.
          With enough practice, you may eventually draw your toes toward the crown of your head.
          To come out, neutralize your spine by straightening through your legs, passing through a forearm stand before you lower one leg down at a time to the floor.
          Resting for a few moments in Child's Pose can help counter the intensity of this backbend, drawing your spine into flexion.</p>

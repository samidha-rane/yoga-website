                    Get on all fours, like a cat.  
                    Shoulder over wrists and hips over knees, with your weight evenly distributed along with your hands and knees.
                    Start with a neutral spine. 
                    Focus on a point in front of you.
                    Inhale and expand the belly toward the floor. 
                    Raise your chin and tilt your head backward toward the spine.
                    Point the tailbone up as you stretch like a cat.
                    Then exhale and pull the belly button in, towards the spine.
                    The chin should rest on the chest and direct your vision toward the nose. 
                    Your back should be rounded.
                    Complete as many rounds as you'd like, working toward a fluid movement that stretches and relaxes your spine.

                    Lie down flat on your abdomen, in the relaxation posture.
                     Cross your hands in front of you so you can place your head on them. 
                    Slowly bring your legs close together. Place your forehead on the floor.
                    Move your arms so that they are folded at the elbow and your palms are close to your shoulders.
                    Raise your elbows off the floor slightly. Inhale. Raise your forehead with your chin pushed out.
                    Raise your torso from the ground. 
                    Ensure that your abdomen remains pressed to the floor. 
                    Reflect on the movement of a snake raising its hood and gradually feel the stretch of your spine. Maintain posture.
                    Unwind slowly till your body is back flat against the floor. Keep your head lifted till your torso completely unrolls.

                    Ensure that your forehead is placed against the floor and that your legs are close together.
                    Bend your legs at the knees and bring your feet up behind you.
                    Stretch your arms backward and grasp your ankles.
                    Inhale. Lift your head off the ground and simultaneously lift your thighs upwards. 
                    Your body should be arching upwards now.
                    Maintain the posture for 10 seconds at the outset.
                    As you practise, you can increase the timing to about one minute.

                    Breathe into your lower back
                    Stay for anywhere between 30 seconds and several minutes in this resting pose
                    To come out, exhale and roll up vertebra by vertebra, or come back to sitting with a straight spine.

        Yoga has its roots from the Sanskrit word yuj which means to join or unite.
    The very origin of the word speaks volumes. It aims to connect your mind and 
    body and to help them work together in peace and as one.
    It works on leading to the union of your consciousness to the universal consciousness. 
    The person who experiences this unity and bond between nature and himself is said to have attained moksha .
    Yoga aims to achieve self-actualization and peace, even when faced with the most difficult tasks.
    That is when you truly achieve kaivalya (freedom). It imparts basic human values and pushes
    human beings towards a sustainable lifestyle filled with joy, peace and gratitude.
    There is Yogic lore that says Yoga has been as old as the dawn of civilization. In this lore,
    Lord Shiva is said to be the first yogi or Adiyogi. Passed down through generations, this story talks of a time 
    when Lord Shiva imparted and taught Yoga to seven of his disciples. These seven disciples went in different
    directions to spread the knowledge of Yoga far and wide. Their knowledge reached areas like Asia, the Middle East,
    Northern Africa and South America.However, there is no proper evidence of when this discipline started It is 
    believed that it originated in Northern India, approximately 5000 years ago.

     <ul>
    <li class="para">In ancient times, man understood the true essence of Yoga. The purpose of Yoga was to connect oneself with 
        the world around them. It focused on breathing and freeing of the body, spirit and mind.</li>
 
    <li class="para">Our ancestors understood the importance of mental hygiene and concluded that regular practice of Yoga will cleanse
        the body and soul of unnecessary pollutants.</li>

    <li class="para">In current times, the spoken benefits of Yoga are limited to fitness, flexibility and ridding oneself of  physical
         disabilities.</li> 

   <li class="para">The true spirit of Yoga that lay in the hygiene of mind and soul, lies forgotten in the graves of our 
       predecessors. </li>

   <li class="para">With the incessant popularity of only Asanas, the people of the world seem to have left behind the eight limbs of Yoga 
       only one of which is Asanas. Yoga, in today's time, is associated only with physical fitness and flexibility due to the increasing popularity of Asana Yoga.
        Over the last couple of years, the seven forgotten limbs are being spoken about by the yogic world.</li>

   <li class="para">New courses and classes are starting up with the intent of helping to spread the full yogic culture.
       The dawn of Covid-19 has made each of us sit back and think of life's true purpose. We have each pondered the true meaning behind it all and made a change in our lifestyles, consciously or not. There is no better way to incorporate this change than including Yoga in our schedule for a fixed time everyday.
       Despite the numerous different customs and traditions in India, Yoga follows no religion or caste. It works solely on imbibing the values of compassion, patience and tolerance within oneself. Yoga not only helps clear the mind but also tones down the agitation and stress that comes with the fast-paced lives of this decade.
       It aims to achieve self-actualization and self-realization on an individual level.  </li>
 
   <li class="para">Yoga has prospered in the eyes of the world. The teachings continue to be spread in the West and enlighten 
       the lives of millions. 21st June has been declared as the International Yoga Day by the United Nations. 
       This is a golden step towards spreading Yoga. This ancient discipline is rightfully given the recognition
       and importance it deserves, as it makes its way to enlighten billions with emotions like love, peace and universal 
       integration.  </li>
